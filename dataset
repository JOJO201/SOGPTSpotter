Understanding Android Units of Measure: px, dip, dp, and sp

In Android development, understanding units of measure is pivotal to creating UIs that are consistent across various devices and screen densities. Here’s a breakdown:

Pixels (px)

Definition: A pixel is a single point in a display.
Usage: It’s the most granular unit but not recommended for defining layouts due to varying screen densities.
Density-Independent Pixels (dip or dp)

Definition: A unit that normalizes the dimensions for different screen sizes and densities.
Usage: It’s widely used for layout dimensions to ensure consistency across different screens.
Scale-Independent Pixels (sp)

Definition: Similar to dp, but it also considers the user's font size settings.
Usage: It’s primarily used for defining text sizes to accommodate user preferences and accessibility settings.
Key Differences:

px vs. dp: px is screen-dependent, while dp ensures uniform display on screens with varying densities.
dp vs. sp: dp is used for general dimensions, while sp is tailored for text sizes, respecting user settings.
Using dp and sp for layouts and text sizes, respectively, ensures a user-friendly and consistent UI experience across diverse Android devices.

Deciphering Android Measurement Units: px, dp, dip, and sp

Developing UIs in Android necessitates a solid grasp of its measurement units to ensure consistent and accessible displays across multiple devices. Let’s delve into each unit:

Pixels (px)

What It Is: A pixel represents a single dot on the display.
When to Use: While precise, using px is generally avoided for layouts due to inconsistency across different screen densities.
Density-Independent Pixels (dp or dip)

What It Is: A unit that provides a uniform dimension across various screen sizes and densities.
When to Use: dp is a standard unit for defining layout dimensions to maintain consistency across diverse screens.
Scale-Independent Pixels (sp)

What It Is: Similar to dp, but it also scales based on the user’s font size preferences.
When to Use: sp is predominantly used for text sizes, ensuring that they adapt to user font size settings.
Distinguishing the Units:

px vs. dp: While px is a fixed dot on the screen, dp offers a density-independent unit ensuring consistent layout across screens.
dp vs. sp: dp is utilized for generic dimensions, while sp is specific for text sizes, adapting to user font size settings.
Employing dp for layout dimensions and sp for text ensures that your Android UI remains consistent and respects user accessibility settings across varied devices.

Human answer:
Pretty much everything about this and how to achieve the best support for multiple screens of different sizes and densities is very well documented here:

Supporting Multiple Screens
Screen size
Actual physical size, measured as the screen's diagonal. For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen sizes into four generalized sizes: small, normal, large, and extra-large.

Screen density
The number of pixels within a physical area of the screen; usually referred to as dpi (dots per inch). For example, a "low" density screen has fewer pixels within a given physical area, compared to a "normal" or "high" density screen. For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen densities into six generalized densities: low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high, and extra-extra-extra-high.

Orientation
The orientation of the screen from the user's point of view. This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the screen's aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware that not only do different devices operate in different orientations by default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user rotates the device.

Resolution
The total number of physical pixels on a screen. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do not work directly with resolution; applications should be concerned only with screen size and density, as specified by the generalized size and density groups.

Density-independent pixel (dp)
A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a "medium" density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi / 160). For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on screens with different densities.

If you are at all serious about developing an Android app for more than one type of device, you should have read the screens support development document at least once. In addition to that, it is always a good thing to know the actual number of active devices that have a particular screen configuration.
